All IN: A 4th Place Hackathon Winner
This is the live repository for 'All IN,' which secured 4th Place (Top 5 Finalist) at HackwithMAIT 6.0 from a pool of 35+ teams.

The Challenge & My Story
This project was a 48-hour sprint. After being shortlisted, we were given direct feedback from the judges to rebuild our Proof-of-Concept in React, a library I had never used before.

This entire React MVP was built overnight to meet the final deadline. It's the result of rapid prototyping to turn an idea into a functional product under extreme pressure.

The Game Narrative: "The Coder's Descent"
'All IN' is an anti-gambling game that models the "domino effect" of addiction.

The Grind: You play as a coder, solving DSA/JEE questions for an in-game "Board" to earn money. This costs you 'Health' and 'Social' stats.

The Temptation: You take your hard-earned money to a slot machine.

The Spiral: You get trapped in a loop of grinding and gambling, leading to "Performance Reviews" and "Burnout Events" as your life stats crash.

Future Plans: Refactoring to MERN
This repository is the starting point for my next big project: refactoring 'All IN' into a full, scalable MERN stack application.
